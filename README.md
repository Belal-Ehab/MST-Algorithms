 This repository contains the final mini-project for CSAI 330: Design and Analysis of Algorithms at NEWGIZA UNIVERSITY. The project implements and visualizes Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) for economic and trade networks using five algorithms: Kruskal's, Prim's, Bor≈Øvka's, Reverse-Delete, and Karger's.
